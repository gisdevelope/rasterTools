***obtain and process earth observation data***

The rasterTools package provides the toolchain for a transparent and reproducible workflow to obtain and process spatial (earth observation) data for an evidence based approach to landscape ecological questions. Keywords: *earth observation data*, *spatial patterns*, *species distribution models*, *landscape metrics*, *(neutral) landscape models*, *evidence based science*

___________________________________________


Getting Started
------------------------------------------------------------


1) Install the development version from github via:

        devtools::install_github('EhrmannS/rasterTools')

2) Read a **brief introduction** to understand the philosophy of `rasterTools`:

        ?`rasterTools-package`

3) The vignettes given an in detail [Introduction](articles/introduction.html) and explain what the logic behind [landscape metrics](articles/landscape_metrics.html) is.

Example workflow
------------------------------------------------------------


1) (Down)load a range of gridded datasets:

        myDatasets <- list(list(operator = "oGFC", years = 2006)),
                           list(operator = "oMODIS", product = "mod17a3",
                                period = 2006, layer = 2),
                           ...)
        myData <- obtain(data = myDatasets, mask = aMask)
                           
2) Determine forest patches in a raster with continuous integer values:

        get_patches <- list(list(operator = "rBinarise", thresh = 30),
                            list(operator = "rPatches"))
        myInput <- rtData$continuous
        myPatches <- modify(input = myInput, by = get_patches, sequential = TRUE)
        visualise(raster::stack(myInput, myPatches))

3) Compute the *Class proportional area* in a raster with categorial values:

        myInput <- rtData$categorial
        myMetric <- list(a_w = list(operator = "mArea", scale = "window"),
                         a_c = list(operator = "mArea", scale = "class"),
                         mCPA = "a_c / a_w * 100")
        measure(input = myInput, with = myMetrics)

Contribute
------------------------------------------------------------


In case you have a suggestion for a feature or function you think is missing, please file an [issue](https://github.com/EhrmannS/rastertools/issues) and I try to implement it. If you want to contribute, [develop your own addition](articles/contribute.html) to `rasterTools` and share it with the community by creating a [pull request](https://github.com/EhrmannS/rastertools/pulls) on github (I will include you as author of the respective function).

___________________________________________


Planned for future versions
------------------------------------------------------------


- Support of the Sentinel (high prio), Landsat and Lidar datasets.

- `geomCurve()` to create lines and curves (high prio); `geomVoronoi()` to create a pattern of voronoi polygons with a random or given point pattern as anchor

- new functions to simulate neutral and process oriented landscape models (high prio).

- Support of various "national forest inventory" datasets (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, yours?)

- `rTilify()` to segregate a gidded dataset into another tiling, for instance to align datasets to each other or produce a hexagonal tiling of a rectangluarly tiled dataset.

- in-R georeferencing.

- more `Rcpp` and parallelisation.

Acknowledgements
------------------------------------------------------------

I am grateful for financial support from the PROFOUND Cost-action, which gave me the opportunity to work in a concentrated effort a large part of the functionality. This package has been developed in support of the [FunBo Project](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Do-small-mammals-think-big-The-multiscale-ecology-of-small-mammals-and-their-functional-role-for-Borrelia-burgdorferi-FunBo), which was made possible by the GrÃ¼newald-Zuberbier Scholarship handed out by the University of Freiburg.

Thanks are due to Prof. Arne Pommerening who was a great source of inspiration for what `rasterTools` is now.
