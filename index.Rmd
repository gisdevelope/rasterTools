***obtain and process earth observation data***

The rasterTools package provides the toolchain for a transparent and reproducible workflow to obtain and process spatial (earth observation) data for an evidence based approach to landscape ecological questions.

___________________________________________


Getting Started
------------------------------------------------------------


1) Install the development version from github via:

        devtools::install_github('EhrmannS/rasterTools')
        
2) Read a **brief introduction** to understand the philosophy of `rasterTools`:

        ?`rasterTools-package`

3) Update the object `rtPaths`, which includes the directories where spatial files may be already stored on your hard-disc, or where they ought to be stored.

        updatePaths(root = "/path/to/the/spatial/files/", project = "/path/to/your/project/")

4) The vignettes explain in detail what [*algorithm* and *operator*](articles/introduction.html) means here and what the logic behind [landscape metrics](articles/landscape_metrics.html) is.

___________________________________________


In a nutshell, `rasterTools` ...
------------------------------------------------------------


- is used to generate spatial patterns (such as neutral landscape models) or obtain information from gridded spatial datasets. It provides options for raster modification and quantification via landscape metrics.

- is aimed at supporting the majority of the important and widely used spatial datasets.

- makes operations based on [mathematical morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_morphology) available for (automated) detection of landscape features.

- provides a simplified and standardized workflow for processing spatial data to improve your publications with respect to reproducibility, comparability and transparency.

- allows prototyping new methods and landscape metrics to explore patterns in landscapes (and other 2D lattices).

Contribute
------------------------------------------------------------


In case you have a suggestion for a feature or function you'd require, please file an [issue](https://github.com/EhrmannS/rastertools/issues) and I try to implement it. If you want to contribute, [develop your own addition](articles/contribute.html) to `rasterTools` and share it with the community by creating a [pull request](https://github.com/EhrmannS/rastertools/pulls) on github (I will include you as author of the respective function).

___________________________________________


Planned for future versions
------------------------------------------------------------


- Support of the Sentinel (high prio), Landsat and Lidar datasets.

- `geomCurve()` to create lines and curves (high prio); `geomVoronoi()` to create a pattern of voronoi polygons with a random or given point pattern as anchor

- new functions to simulate neutral and process oriented landscape models (high prio).

- Support of various "national forest inventory" datasets (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, yours?)

- `rTilify()` to segregate a gidded dataset into another tiling, for instance to align datasets to each other or produce a hexagonal tiling of a rectangluarly tiled dataset.

- in-R georeferencing.

- more `Rcpp`.

Acknowledgements
------------------------------------------------------------

I am grateful for financial support from the PROFOUND COST-action, which gave me the opportunity to finalise in a concentrated effort a large part of the functionality.

Thanks are due to Prof. Arne Pommerening who was a great source of inspiration for what `rasterTools` is now.

Moreover, I owe thanks to people like Alex Zvoleff ([`gfcanalysis`](ttp://azvoleff.com/gfcanalysis)) and Jon Clayden ([`mmand`](https://github.com/jonclayden/mmand)), who inspired me with their uncompromising and creative code-work.
