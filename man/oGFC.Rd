\description{
Obtain data from the 'Global Forest Change'

(\href{https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1244693}{paper})

\details{
The GFC dataset is based on a time-series analysis of Landsat images
  characterizing forest extent and change.

  A problem with the GFC dataset is that the gain-layer is calculated for the
  overall period from 2000 to 2014, while the loss-layer contains the loss
  events on a yearly basis. Hence, to find the true value per year for a
  raster-cell may not be straightforward. In \code{oGFC} a yearly value is
  derived by removing all loss events up to the year in question from the
  \emph{year 2000}-layer and subsequently adding the \emph{gain}-layer. Gain
  events are in nature rather diffuse and happen progressively and relatively
  slowely throughout time. A raster cell, which was marked as "forest absent"
  in 2000 and which had a positive gain-value by 2014, "became tree" within
  this time-frame (i.e. became over 5 m tall). This event, "becoming tree",
  presumably does not mean that the vegetation in this raster cell grew to a
  tall and mature forest. Much rather it would have some hight between 5 m
  and what a tree in the given region can grow in that short time. To get a
  more accurate estimation of the forest cover - particularly in very dynamic
  landscapes - it might be wise to weigh the forest cover with some sort of
  productivity and/or macroclimate dataset, because more suitable sites
  result in faster growth of trees.
