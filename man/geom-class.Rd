\title{Geometry class (S4) and methods}
\description{
A \code{geom} stores the vertices that outline the shape and all additional
information that characterise a feature. A \code{geom} can be spatial, but
does not have to be. A \code{geom} can either have absolute or relative
values, where relative values specify the vertex position relative to the
\code{window} slot.
}
\details{
A \code{geom} either has the feature type \itemize{ \item \code{"point"},
when none of the vertices are connected to other vertices, \item
\code{"line"}, when vertices with the same id are connected according to
their order without the line closing in itself and \item \code{"polygon"}
according to the same definition, except that the line closes in itself.}
Moreover, a \code{geom} does NOT have the slot \emph{extent}, which
characterises the minimum and maximum value of the vertex coordinates and
which is thus derived "on the fly" from the vertices. Instead it has a
\emph{reference window}, which is sort of a second extent that may be bigger
than \code{extent} and which determines the relative position of the vertices
when plotting.
