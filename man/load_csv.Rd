\description{
csv is the short form of \emph{Comma Separated Values}, which represents
simple tables of systematically delimited information. The files loaded with
this function should have the columns \code{x}, \code{y} and potentially
other columns that represent the attributes of these coordinates, for example
an \code{id}.
}
\details{
A column \code{fid} can have a deviating value than \code{id} when several
features are part of the same object, such as multiple line features or holes
in polygons.

This is a helper to \code{\link{loadData}} and is not intended to be used on
its own.
