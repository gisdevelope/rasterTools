# rasterTools

***obtain and process earth observation data***

The rasterTools package provides a toolchain for a transparent and reproducible workflow to obtain and process spatial (earth observation) data for an evidence based approach to landscape ecological questions.


## Getting started

1) Install the development version from github via:

        devtools::install_github("EhrmannS/rasterTools")

2) Read a **brief introduction** to understand the philosophy of `rasterTools`:

        ?`rasterTools-package`

3) The vignettes given an in detail [Introduction](https://ehrmanns.github.io/rasterTools/articles/introduction.html) and explain what the logic behind [landscape metrics](https://ehrmanns.github.io/rasterTools/articles/landscape_metrics.html) is.

## Example workflow

1) (Down)load a range of gridded datasets:

        myDatasets <- list(list(operator = "oGFC", years = 2006)),
                           list(operator = "oMODIS", product = "mod17a3",
                                period = 2006, layer = 2),
                           ...)
        myData <- obtain(data = myDatasets, mask = aMask)
                           
2) Determine forest patches in a raster with continuous integer values of tree-cover:

        get_patches <- list(list(operator = "rBinarise", thresh = 30),
                            list(operator = "rPatches"))
        myInput <- rtData$continuous
        myPatches <- modify(input = myInput, by = get_patches, sequential = TRUE)
        visualise(raster::stack(myInput, myPatches))

3) Compute the *Class proportional area* in a raster with categorial values:

        myInput <- rtData$categorial
        myMetric <- list(a_l = list(operator = "mArea", scale = "landscape"),
                         a_c = list(operator = "mArea", scale = "class"),
                         mCPA = "a_c / a_l * 100")
        measure(input = myInput, with = myMetric)

## Planned for future versions
- Support of the Sentinel, Landsat and Lidar datasets.

- `geomCurve()` to create lines and curves; `geomVoronoi()` to create a pattern of voronoi polygons with a random or given point pattern as anchor

- Support of various "national forest inventory" datasets (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, yours?)

- `rTilify()` to segregate a gidded dataset into another tiling, for instance to align datasets to each other or produce a hexagonal tiling of a rectangluarly tiled dataset.

- in-R georeferencing.

- more `Rcpp`, `gdal` and parallelisation.

- new functions to simulate neutral and process oriented landscape models.

- ...

- You are encouraged to [participate](articles/contribute.html) as well by writing for instance an obtain operator for your favourite dataset.

## Acknowledgements
I am grateful for financial support from the PROFOUND Cost-action, which gave me the opportunity to work in a concentrated effort a large part of the functionality. This package has been developed in support of the [FunBo Project](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Do-small-mammals-think-big-The-multiscale-ecology-of-small-mammals-and-their-functional-role-for-Borrelia-burgdorferi-FunBo), which was made possible by the GrÃ¼newald-Zuberbier Scholarship handed out by the University of Freiburg.

Thanks are also due to Prof. Arne Pommerening who was a great source of inspiration for what `rasterTools` is now.
